# Novelty
In this branch we will give way to our imagination.

We have thought about testing by dividing the dataset according to the city where the cases occurred.

We also wanted to demonstrate our power unsupervised, which is why we have used clustering in an easy way to see the results that it offers us unsupervised.

We also see it interesting to do a study per week and also per year.

All models use the RandomForest algorithm except clustering which uses DecisionTreeRegressor.The models used are the following:
  - [Dengue Upgrade Cities](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Novelty/Dengue_Upgrade_Cities.ipynb)
  - [Dengue_Upgrade_Cities_Weeks](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Novelty/Dengue_Upgrade_Cities_Weeks.ipynb)
  - [Dengue Upgrade Cities Weeks Years](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Novelty/Dengue_Upgrade_Cities_Weeks_Years.ipynb)
  - [Dengue Upgrade Cities_Years](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Novelty/Dengue_Upgrade_Cities_Years.ipynb)
  - [Dengue Upgrade Hierarchy Clustering](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Novelty/Dengue_Upgrade_Hierarchy_Clustering.ipynb)
