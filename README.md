# DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread
## Challenge Summary
Welcome to the repository of the SSJ work team, where a study will be carried out on the creation of models for the prediction of the spread of dengue disease in the cities of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru. 

All the information on the challenge can be found at the following link: [official website of the challenge DengAI](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/ "official website").

To help the visitor:
  - The data can be found at the following link:  [Data DengAI](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/data/ "challenge data").
  - And the explanation of the problem in this: [Problem Description](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/82/ "description of the problem")


## Structuring the challenge
Our approach will be, once the data has been processed and the best characteristics are chosen, we will test regression models from the library sklearn (AdaBoost, Boosting, DecisionTree, KNN, NaiveBayes, RandomForest, SVC).

This repository is organized in different branches:

- [Baseline](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/tree/Baseline "click to go baseline"): With a minimum configuration we will test the models and see the scores that it returns.

- [Optimization](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/tree/Optimization "click to go optimization"): We hyperparameterize the algorithms to try to get the best models that these algorithms can offer us.

- [Novelty](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/tree/Novelty "click to go novelty"): Modifications and other tests are attempted to achieve more efficient and accurate predictor models.
