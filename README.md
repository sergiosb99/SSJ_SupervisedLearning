# Baseline
In this branch the beginning of our study takes place.

Before starting to think about what models could be made, we have done a study on the data that they have provided us to do the study.

In the [Dengue_First_Look](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_First_Look.ipynb) notebook you can find an analysis of the features that make up the train data set, studying their correlation, and what variables are those that influence the spread of dengue.

Once the data has been studied, the first models are created. The following algorithms have been used:
  - [KNN](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_KNN.ipynb)
  - [Naive - Bayes](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_NaiveBayes.ipynb)
  - [Decision Trees](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_DecisionTree.ipynb)
  - [Random Forest](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_RandomForest.ipynb)
  - [Boosting](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_Boosting.ipynb)
  - [AdaBoost](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_AdaBoost.ipynb)
  - [SVC](https://github.com/sergiosb99/SSJ_SupervisedLearning/blob/Baseline/Dengue_SVC.ipynb)
  
A simple optimization has been used for the creation of the models of these algorithms.
The idea is to check which of the algorithms produce the best results in view of future improvements and tests to achieve an efficient model.
